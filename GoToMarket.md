# URBANIC - Go To Market
## Generate distributed wellbeing for an eco-friendly society

We help companies reduce their carbon footprint and encourage behaviours that help combat climate change 
through the use of blockchain.

### Value Proposition
Urbanic is a system that through the use of blockchain technology, allows people to generate income by 
taking actions that benefit the environment thanks to the support of companies concerned about reducing their 
carbon emissions

Urbanic has 3 key components: companies, communities and people.

1. **Companies**
Companies concerned about reducing their carbon emissions into the atmosphere participate by purchasing carbon 
credits through urbanic, these revenues are tokenized and put into circulation so that anyone who performs 
environmentally friendly actions can participate to earn a reward for their work.

2. **Communities**
All regional communities whose objective is to stop or reverse climate change can participate as observers 
validating that the actions taken by the end users have a real impact on the environment while suggesting rules 
of operation according to the region where they are located.

3. **End Users**
They are people concerned about the environment with a desire to have a green life, with their daily actions 
they help to stop or reverse climate change generating a verifiable impact for others, they receive rewards from 
companies for their contributions to motivate them to continue generating more benefits and an alternative income.


**Distribution**
Urbanic is distributed as a digital application that can be used by end users in all regions where vigilante 
communities exist.


During Urbanic's market release stage all marketing efforts will be focused on obtaining product market fit, 
so campaigns will be focused on getting the business idea to as many people as possible in order to attract 
potential interested parties

**User Acquisition Model**
1. Social media: Because of its viralization power and according to the ages of the end users it is planned to 
use Facebook and Instagram to reach the highest number of total users.

2. Crowdfunding
Among the diffusion techniques, a crowdfunding campaign is planned to raise initial capital and start generating 
hype for the application in addition to market validation and real feedback in a controlled environment.

3. Search
Through direct search in google or other search engines we try to acquire as many users as possible.

4. Agreements with civil organizations
All NGOs whose mission is to generate a positive environmental impact on society can come forward to participate

5. Why blockchain is essential
The current process faces 2 main problems, the first is the certainty for carbon emitting companies to see that 
they observe a transparent process where they choose the actions to which the resources will be allocated.
The second problem faced by carbon credits is the difficulty in ensuring that the related actions generate real 
impacts on the environment

The use of the blockchain is fundamental for the implementation of this system because it allows individuals to 
have a certainty of the distribution of the benefits in an individual, completely auditable and transparent way

It allows traceability, auditing, decentralization of responsibilities for actions on behalf of a company that 
wants to repair the damage it has done to the environment.
